# Deliverables

## Progress updates

````{margin}
```{note}
Total of three progress updates are required:
* January 31, 2021
* February 21, 2021
* March 14, 2021
```
````
Each team will create progress blog-style progress updates under **PROJECTS** section of this class website (replacing the current placeholder page). Your updates are to be written for a audience of your peers (e.g. a friend in another major) to follow the progress of your team. Focus on giving a high-level conceptual view of your project. Define domain-specific terminology or link to an external resource when needed.

Your progress update page will become a part of class website, which uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). Jupyter Book pages can be authored with [different types of files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/index.html).

```{tip}
* Consider the document as periodic milestones toward your final report and presentation.
* After initial updates, you can continue to modify and improve your updates.
```
````
In order to create your post, follow these steps:

* Make a fork of the source code of our [class website repository](https://github.com/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io). You can freely edit this repository without breaking the main class website.
* Share this repository with your teammates to collaborate on the content.
* Build a clone of the class website with your page in place.
* Create a pull request to the main class website for us to review and merge into the main class website!
