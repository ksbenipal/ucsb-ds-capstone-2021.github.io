# Meetings/Participation

Each team will collectively keep track of attendance in a [shared Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBH5tDCe9k_Z0TM9R6zQupgnGf2no3KFRCqQBHB5XlA/edit?usp=sharing) (sharing settings not yet configured).

## Lecture time sessions

We will discuss topics of interest for the whole class during lecture times (MW 5-6:15 pm PST). Students are expected to attend. 

The lecture zoom link can be accessed from the calendar on the [welcome page.](https://ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/welcome.html)

```{note}
We don't expect to meet every session, and class Google calendar will reflect any cancellations.
```

## Team meetings

Team meetings will be central to your project work. Students will give weekly updates and receive guidance and suggestions based on their findings.

Each project team will collectively decide on a weekly standing meeting time. A team representative will update the class Google calendar with the meeting information including the Zoom link.

```{tip}
Recommended weekly meeting format:

* **First 30-45 minutes**: weekly updates and discussion with sponsor and faculty mentor
* **Second 30-45 minutes**: discussion with faculty mentor on statistical methods and tools
```

## Discussion times

These times are held as placeholders for additional common time slots. These time slots can be used for ad-hoc meetings, requesting help from TAs, etc.

```{tip}
TAs will work with you to troubleshoot technology problems
