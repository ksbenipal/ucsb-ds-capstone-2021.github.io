## Introduction
The CSEP Alumni Tracking Project tracks students graduating from  2000 - 2018 from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The overall goal of tracking students is monitoring opportunities UCSB provides and the impact on student outcomes. 

The data comes from a mix of sources: online - LinkedIn, personal websites, and professional organizations - and UCSB's information about students. While not all of the data was accessed through an automated system, some of it required some manual revisions to determine if a student's data is updated. So while we collected from some of the sources listed above, there will exist some type of error whether it is a simple misspelling of a word to texts existing in an integer column. 

The organization providing the data does not have an overall goal for the outcome of the data: the CSEP group is free to explore any possible avenue for the data within reason.  

## CSEP Website  
The CSEP team felt it is beneficial to share the projects results with students. In order to do so, we are creating a website to display our results. The website is written using a web framework called Django. Django is a high-level python web framework that encourages reusability and scalability. Therefore, instead of having to rewrite html for every webpage, Django lets us use pages like building blocks and scale from there.
