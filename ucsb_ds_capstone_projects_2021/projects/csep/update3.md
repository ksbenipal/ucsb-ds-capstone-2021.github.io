## Introduction
The CSEP Alumni Tracking Project tracks students graduating from  2000 - 2018 from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The overall goal of tracking students is monitoring opportunities UCSB provides and the impact on student outcomes. 

The data comes from a mix of sources: online - LinkedIn, personal websites, and professional organizations - and UCSB's information about students. While not all of the data was accessed through an automated system, some of it required some manual revisions to determine if a student's data is updated. So while we collected from some of the sources listed above, there will exist some type of error whether it is a simple misspelling of a word to texts existing in an integer column. 

The organization providing the data does not have an overall goal for the outcome of the data: the CSEP group is free to explore any possible avenue for the data within reason.
